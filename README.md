# 🧠 External Memory for Custom GPTs

This is a lightweight external memory system that supercharges your Custom GPT with the ability to **store, retrieve, and reason** over structured knowledge using **Airtable**.

This project was built to solve a real-world problem: capturing fleeting ideas, tasks, and research topics *without interrupting the flow*. Now, with a simple Airtable backend and OpenAI Actions, you can give your GPT external memory—and *upgrade your life, majorly*.

## 🚀 What It Does

- 📥 **Submit thoughts, tasks, or research ideas** via a simple form
- 🔍 **Retrieve structured entries** using a custom GPT with read access
- 🧠 **Summarize, prioritize, and group ideas** with intelligent prompts
- ✅ **Update priority and mark tasks as completed** (PATCH requests)
- ✍️ **Add new entries directly** from the GPT (when you're ready)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- [OpenAI Custom GPTs](https://platform.openai.com/gpts)
- [Airtable API](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction)
- JSON-based Action schema with `Bearer` token auth
- No-code frontend form (built within Airtable)

---

## 📂 Files Included

- `AirtableSchema.yaml` – GPT Action schema for Airtable integration

---

## 🧪 How to Get Started

1. **Clone this repo** or copy the schema.
2. **Create your Airtable base** with fields matching the schema.
3. **Generate a Personal Access Token** (PAT) with read/write access.
4. **Configure your GPT's Actions** using the schema and your token.
5. **Test API calls** and expand GPT behaviors with prompt training.

## 👥 Who This Is For

- Couples, collaborators, and co-creators
- Productivity nerds & systems thinkers
- Anyone who wants to offload mental clutter without writing code

---

## 🔐 Security Reminder

PATs are secrets—**never share them publicly**. Store them securely (e.g., in a password manager or environment variable if applicable).
